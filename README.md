## Derived Investing

A Mathematical approach to Investments on Cryptographic Assets
<br>

 Using multi-exchange exchange rate history, the custom server built for this webpage quiries the past three years of exchange rate data and compiles the data into a single mathematical function using an advanced, polynonial-inclusive variant of least-squares regression, and returns the data to be graphed on the front-end. 
 
## Next Update

 - Function will be derived two times (both of which will also be displayed on graph
 - Derivative data will work cohesively with function graph and modern technical analysis methods to create trendlines and potentially extrapolate floor / ceiling breaking trends.
 
 Known Issue:
 The mathematical function returns correct output through a 7th degree polynomial, where the function graph flips.
